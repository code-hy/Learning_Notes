# Serverless Deep Learning

In the previous module, we built and trained a clothes classification deep learning module using Pytorch.  This module focuses
on deploying it.l  The model categorises images of clothing items uploaded by users on a website.  Deployment will be used using
AWS Lamda, a serverless solution to execute code without maanaging servers, and instead of **TensorFlow**  , we use
*TensorFlow-lite* for this.
