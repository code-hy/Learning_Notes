## What is FastAPI?

FastAPI is a web framework for building APIs. Its key features are:

*   **Fast:** Very high performance, on par with NodeJS and Go (thanks to Starlette and Pydantic).
*   **Fast to Code:** Increases the speed of developing features by about 200% to 300%.
*   **Fewer Bugs:** Reduces about 40% of human-induced errors.
*   **Intuitive:** Great editor support, with autocomplete everywhere. Less time debugging.
*   **Easy:** Designed to be easy to use and learn. Less time reading docs.
*   **Standards-Based:** Based on (and fully compatible with) the open standards for APIs: **OpenAPI** (formerly known as Swagger) and **JSON Schema**.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:
*   **Python 3.7+**
*   A code editor (like VS Code)
*   A terminal or command prompt

## Installation

You'll need two main packages: `fastapi` for the framework itself and `uvicorn` to be the server that runs your code.

```bash
pip install "fastapi[all]"
```

### 
Note: Installing fastapi[all] includes uvicorn and other useful dependencies. For production, you might want to install fastapi and uvicorn separately: pip install fastapi "uvicorn[standard]".

## Your First API: "Hello, World"
Let's create a minimal API. Create a file named main.py:

### This is a Python code block
```python
# main.py

from fastapi import FastAPI

# Create an instance of the FastAPI class
app = FastAPI()

# Define a path operation decorator
@app.get("/")
# Define the path operation function
async def read_root():
    return {"Hello": "World"}
```

#### Explanation:
1.  from fastapi import FastAPI: Imports the main FastAPI class.
2.  app = FastAPI(): Creates an instance of your application. This will be the central point of your API.
3.  @app.get("/"): This is a "decorator". It tells FastAPI that the function right below it is in charge of handling requests that go to:
    The path /.
    Using the HTTP GET operation.
4.  async def read_root():: An async function. FastAPI can handle async functions natively, which is great for performance.
5.  return {"Hello": "World"}: FastAPI will take this dictionary, convert it to JSON, and send it back to the client.
