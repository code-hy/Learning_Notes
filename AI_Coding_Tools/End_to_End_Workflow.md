# Creating End-to-End Application using AI entirely

## Workflow

1.  Create front-end using Lovable  (lovable.dev).  Lovable is a good tool for quickly creating a nice looking prototype.  In the second module, Alex implemented the front-end code by using a prompt
    ``` prompt
          create the snake game with two models: pass-through and walls. prepare to make it multiplayers - we will have this functionality: leaderboard and watching (me following other players that currently play).
          add mockups for that and also for log in. everything should be interactive - I can log in, sign up, see my username when I'm logged in, see leaderboard, see other people play
          (in this case just implement some playing logic yourself as if somebody is playing) make sure that all the logic is covered with tests don't implement backend, so everything is mocked.
          But centralize all the calls to the backend in one place
    
    ```
    this creates the front-end code. To put to Github, Alex clicked on the Github Icon <img width="48" height="48" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5cd10a48-fedd-43e0-9df5-9e2b12a30a95" />
 , and connected Lovable to the repository, following interactive instructions in authorising Lovable to access the github repo
