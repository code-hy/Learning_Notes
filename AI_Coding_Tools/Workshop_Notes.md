# AI Coding Tools Compared:

##  Using ChatGPT to code Snake Game 
1.  Ask ChatGPT by prompting 'Create Snake Game using React'
2.  ChatGPT paid version has a preview to run the code
3.  To run locally:  prompt ChatGPT for instructions.  Follow instructions provided by ChatGPT to run the game locally
4.  If following locally lead to errors, ask ChatGPT to go search for latest Tailwind instructions 


##  Using Claude.AI to code Snake Game  (Claude seems to be better at coding)
1.  In Claude.AI  ,  use same prompt to create Snake Game,  , and it will have preview.  
2.  In Claude also provide same prompt to run locally
3.  For free plan, you may run out of free messages (free tier provides limited messages)

# Coding Assistants  / Integerated Developmenty Environment or IDEs
1.  Claude Code (anthropic) (doesn't feel like IDE)  feels more like command line
     *  can read files, can write files
     *  creates todo list and proceeds with it
     *  can run commands in command line terminal
     *  does not need to run IDE
     *  cost around $0.28 cents to create the snake game app
     *  test game with arrow keys - has scoring

     *  claude is quite powerful (pay as you go or via subscription around $20/month)


2.  Github Copilot
     *  microsoft co-pilot and github co-pilot are different... github co-pilot is integrated into visual studio code
     *  you can enter chat like ' explain and describe the project' it will read thru all the files, and try to describe the          application
     *  <img width="1385" height="683" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dcc01425-8e6d-494a-b840-896db9e634a3" />

     *  you can refactor it, and put the logic into the snake game component
     *  accept the changes...
  
     *  npm run dev
     *
